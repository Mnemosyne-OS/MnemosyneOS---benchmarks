# LongMemEval-M full-haystack — campaign summary (2026-07-13/14)

**Status: closed.** Every HIT below was replayed before being counted (§4).

## Headline

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| LongMemEval-M full-haystack, 48-question stratified set, baseline (topK32, no consolidation) | **64.6 %** (31/48) |
| Same, with the full engine on the multi-session category | **72.9 %** (35/48) — *composed*, and a *lower bound* |
| Multi-session category | **1/8 → 5/8** (12.5 % → 62.5 %), every HIT replay-stable |
| Reference: the LongMemEval paper's GPT-4o full-context result | ~60 % — on the **easier** `-S` variant |
| Reference: oracle-variant ceiling (evidence-only vaults, no distractors) | ~84 % |
| Reference: fully local (Qwen2.5-3B, zero cloud calls) | ~50 % (n=12) |

**"Full-haystack" is the hard variant**: ~480 distractor sessions surround the
evidence for every question, mixing dozens of unrelated personas' first-person
conversations into the corpus. It is the variant closest to a real, lived-in
memory vault — not the easier `-S` slice most published numbers use.

**72.9 % is composed, and it is a stated lower bound.** Two separate facts:

1. **Composed** — only the multi-session category (8 questions) was re-run with
   the full engine (spine-sort → per-topic consolidation → dream-tier retrieval).
   The other 40 rows are carried verbatim from the 64.6 % baseline. There has
   never been a single 48-question run of the full engine, and 72.9 % should not
   be quoted as one. `node verify.js` in the verification kit recomputes and
   prints the composition: `30/40 carried + 5/8 measured = 35/48`.
2. **Lower bound** — the knowledge-update and preference-tracking categories were
   never retried with the engine, so a full re-run can only raise the figure (see
   "Open next steps" below).

## What was tested

The engine under test: **LLM spine-sort** (an unsupervised pass that groups
raw memory chunks into clean per-topic buckets) → **per-topic consolidation
ledgers** (a separate model reads each topic and writes a dense, dated summary
— written *question-blind*, never told what will be asked) → **dream-tier
retrieval** (the ledgers ride alongside raw chunks at answer time).

The hypothesis: multi-session questions — the ones needing facts stitched
across many separate conversations — fail under full-haystack load because the
raw chunks are undifferentiated `SESSION`-type text with no topic structure.
Clean per-topic consolidation should recover them. **Confirmed** — but only
after two false starts (see root causes below).

No configuration reaches 6/8. Two configs tie at 5/8 with **disjoint** wins —
each recovers a different question the other misses — which is itself the
finding in root cause #3 below.

## Reading these logs: which 5 questions are the cited 5/8

**Important if you're auditing the raw logs.** They contain *several* configs,
including ones that were tried and rejected, and more than one of them lands on
5/8 with a **different** set of questions. Grepping totals across all 16 logs
will therefore look contradictory. Here is the key.

The cited config is the base full engine (spine-sort → uncapped per-topic
consolidation → dream-tier retrieval). Its per-question ledger, with **both runs
behind every verdict**, is published at
[`verification-kit/results/engine-multisession-8q.jsonl`](../verification-kit/results/engine-multisession-8q.jsonl):

| Question | Verdict | Run 1 | Run 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0a995998` clothing | **HIT** | `spine-dream-preflight2.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` HIT |
| `b5ef892d` camping | **HIT** | `spine-dream-multirun.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` HIT |
| `e831120c` MCU/Star Wars | **HIT** *(already a baseline HIT)* | `spine-dream-multirun.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` HIT |
| `3a704032` plants | **HIT** | `spine-dream-multirun.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` HIT |
| `gpt4_d84a3211` bike spend | **HIT** | `spine-dream-multirun.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` HIT |
| `gpt4_59c863d7` model kits | MISS — *discarded first-run HIT* | `spine-dream-multirun.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` MISS |
| `aae3761f` road trips | MISS — *discarded first-run HIT* | `spine-dream-multirun.log` HIT | `exp-verify.log` MISS |
| `6d550036` projects | MISS | `spine-dream-q2.log` MISS | `exp-verify.log` MISS |

**The two discarded HITs, and why they're different failures:**

- `gpt4_59c863d7` — **judge noise.** The engine gave the *same* answer ("6 model
  kits"; ground truth "five") on both runs. The first run's judge scored it HIT,
  the replay scored it MISS. The first verdict was simply wrong.
- `aae3761f` — **answer variance.** Run 1 answered "15 hours" and was correctly
  scored HIT; run 2 found only two of the three trips, answered "11 hours", and
  was correctly scored MISS. The judge was right both times; the engine wasn't
  stable.

Both are scored **MISS** under rule #1 below. Note also that `e831120c` was
already a baseline HIT — so the engine's **net recovery is 4 questions**, not 5.

**Other logs you will find, and what they are:** `exp-slice-all8[-replay].log` is
the windowed-slicing config — it also scores 5/8 but recovers `aae3761f` while
losing `3a704032` (the trade-off in root cause #3), so it is *not* the cited
number. `exp-master-all8[-replay].log` is the map-reduce merge config, which was
**rejected as a regression** (4/8 then 5/8, unstable) and is published only
because negative results belong in the record.

## Root causes of the remaining misses

1. **A size-based cap on ledger coverage.** The first attempt kept only the
   40 largest topics; the missing evidence lived in an 8-chunk topic that got
   cut. Evidence hides in *small* topics — never cap consolidation coverage by
   topic size. Fixed in the production writer (backfill-first topic
   selection).
2. **Benchmark-structural distractor contamination.** Two of the three
   remaining misses trace to *other personas'* first-person conversations in
   the shared haystack being indistinguishable, in isolation, from the target
   user's. This failure mode is an artifact of a shared-haystack benchmark
   format — it does not exist in a real, single-user memory vault.
3. **Write/read coverage is a coupled equilibrium.** The third miss traced to
   one evidence chunk sitting one position past a 40-chunk-per-topic write cap
   in a large topic. Removing the cap (windowed slicing) recovers that
   question — but shifts which single pre-computed fact the ledger
   emphasizes, costing a *different* question. Slicing alone is a trade, not a
   net win; it needs retrieval-side dedupe to ship as a net gain.

## Methodology rules

1. **Replay before you cite.** Five false verdicts were caught this campaign
   (judge noise, sampling variance) — a HIT counts only once it reproduces on
   a second, independent run.
2. **One config for the cited number.** No per-question cherry-picking: 72.9 %
   uses one uniform configuration across all 8 multi-session questions.
3. **Question-blind writers.** Every consolidation prompt says "summarize this
   topic" — never "answer question X." The model writing the memory never
   sees the benchmark question.
4. **Trace every lever to the exact failing line before building it.** The two
   levers that worked (uncapped ledger coverage, windowed slicing) both came
   from tracing one missing fact to its exact source chunk. The two levers
   that were tried and refused (relation tags, map-reduce merging) came from
   plausible-sounding reasoning without that trace — and made things worse.

## Open next steps

- Re-run the knowledge-update and preference-tracking categories with the same
  engine — they were never retried, so 72.9 % is an honest lower bound, not a
  ceiling.
- Ship windowed slicing with retrieval-side per-topic dedupe, to capture its
  gain without its cost (root cause #3).
- A query-decomposition pass for temporal questions that compare two dates.

## Reproducing this

The harness that produced these logs (`spine-dream-fh.cjs` and its
supporting scripts) is not published in this repo — it's tightly coupled to
Mnemosyne's internal memory engine and isn't a standalone tool. It's
**available on motivated request** (open an issue on this repo, or reach out
via the links in the [main Mnemosyne OS README](https://github.com/Mnemosyne-OS/Mnemosyne-Neural-OS)).

The dataset itself is the public [LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval)
benchmark (Wu et al.) — the `-M` full-haystack variant, 48 questions
stratified across its 5 question categories (single-session-user,
single-session-assistant, single-session-preference, temporal-reasoning,
knowledge-update, multi-session).
